- Showcase my professional portfolio to recruiters and employers.
- Apply modern RAG architecture using vector databases and LLMs.

## Technical Requirements
- Vector database for semantic search (Upstash Vector recommended).
- Embeddings model for storing structured profile data.
- Agentic LLM capable of tool-calling.
- GitHub repository for version control.
- ClickUp for project management tracking.

## Functional Requirements
- Retrieve relevant career information from vector database.
- Generate grounded interview answers using retrieved data.
- Simulate professional interview scenarios.
- Produce hiring recommendation outputs.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Professional tone in generated responses.
- Reliable retrieval accuracy.
- Secure handling of personal data.
- Clear documentation and reproducibility.

## Acceptance Criteria
- AI can answer interview questions about my profile.
- Responses are grounded in stored data.
- Repository shows structured AI engineering workflow.
- Documentation supports future improvements.
