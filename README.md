# Digital Twin – Pema Yangzom

## Overview
This repository contains my Digital Twin AI project developed as part of an AI Builder program. The goal is to create a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that represents my professional profile and can support AI-driven interview preparation and recruiter interaction.

This Digital Twin reflects my background in:

- Data Analytics
- Artificial Intelligence studies
- Agricultural research experience
- Healthcare support work
- Academic research and technical projects
